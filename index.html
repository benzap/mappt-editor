	  <p>
	    Mappt Editor is a tool I wrote to help develop map routes
	    over the SVG maps that we have created. The tool is still
	    in development. Expect bugs and constant frustration.

	    <h2>What it <i>can do</i></h2>
	    <p>The tool is used to plot nodes on a map. The nodes are
	      then given different characteristics based on
	      information provided by the user. For example, a node
	      placed on a door would be given the characteristics of
	      type <b>DOOR</b>, and then might include a description on
	      where the door leads.
	    </p>
	    <p>A few things that this editor is capable of:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Add and remove nodes from the map</li>
	      <li>Add and remove links from the map</li>
	      <li>Zoom and Pan the map</li>
	      <li>Export the resulting map layout to the console</li>
	      <li>Import JSON for a given layout</li>
	      <li>Locally save a map node layout</li>
	      <li>Locally load a map node layout, with a remote fallback</li>
	      <li>Edit node descriptions</li>
	      <li>Edit groups of node descriptions</li>
	    </ul>

	      A few things that this editor is not capable of yet:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>This editor cannot properly save any of the map
		layouts <b>remotely</b>, but I have worked out a
		workaround described in <a href="">The
		  Collaboration</a>.</li>
	      <li>
		This editor is not meant for commercial use as of yet,
		and possibly includes a few bugs. If you find a bug,
		please let me know.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		This editor is not <i>Full-featured</i>, you're going
		to get frustrated with some of the lacking features,
		and I understand. However, I want feedback on what you
		would consider a good feature, and in time, I might
		even be able to implement them.

	  <h1>The Collaboration</h1>
	  <p>
	    Since our map making collaboration, i've been trying to
	    think of easier ways for us to stay connected, and work on
	    things together in a more efficient manner.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One of the ways I was thinking of making our process
	    faster, is to share one single network drive, that we can
	    all access. This drive will appear on your computer, and
	    will allow you to add, remove and edit files as though it were
	    on your computer.
	  </p>
	  <p>The basic process that we will carry out for this collaboration:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Get assigned a map, and edit it for any imperfections.</li>
	    <li>While within the editor, choose the map layout you
	    were assigned, and perform node layouts</li>
	    <li>When a portion of designated amount of work has been
	    finished, export the resulting JSON and copy the results
	    to a file named <i>mapLayoutName</i>.svg.json and place it
	    within remote folder under ./floorplans_data/</li>
	    <li>Repeat</li>
	  </ul>
	  The full explanation on how to setup the remote drive can be
	  found in the next section <a href="">Getting Started</a>
